✅ Use Case Practiced Today (Sep 13)

Created an IAM user with restricted access to an S3 bucket.

Wrote notes on IAM & Git.

Pushed notes to GitHub repository.

✅ Use Case: EC2 + Git Combined (Sep 14)

Think of it like this:

AWS side: You launch a Linux server (EC2) and validate it works (uname -a).

Git side: You document that in your repo by creating a feature branch (dev), making changes, and merging into the main branch.

This mimics real project workflows:

You test something on cloud (new server, new feature).

You log/document/update configs in a separate branch.

Once verified, you merge to main for everyone to use.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Use Case – Combine Both (Sep 15)

On AWS: You create and mount, unmount an extra EBS volume on your EC2 instance.

On GitHub: You fork a repo, make a change, and raise a PR.

This simulates a real-world scenario:

As a DevOps/cloud engineer, you add extra storage for logs/app data.

At the same time, you contribute to a project by raising a PR.
